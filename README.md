- 👋 Hi, I’m @JayWarrenTX
- 👀 I’m interested in learning to code. I have no professional tech experience, and barely learned Basic 20 years ago.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning JavaScript, HTML, and CSS. I'm hoping to learn Solidity soon after.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on anything. I want to learn this skillset the best I can.
- 📫 Jay.residenthero@gmail.com
